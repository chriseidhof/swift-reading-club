This paper introduces a new higher-order intermediate-representation for compilers using a graph of dependencies instead of explicit scope (as in continuation-passing-style) or going down to something very imperative (like static-single-assignment (SSA) form). The paper introduces the form and then talks about optimizations focusing on the novel “lambda mangling” optimization.

Figure 1 shows a simple higher-order function compiled to an imperative IR and to the graph IR (called Thorin) and then an optimized version. We spent a big portion of the discussion just going over these figures. Arrows point to dependencies in the Thorin version. The optimized Thorin version removes constant values from “functions” and just points to the values directly.

Initially I had assumed that the dependency graph was similar to [De Bruijn indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index), but Chris pointed out that De Bruijn indices point to the binding lambda (the scope) that the variable belongs to whereas the edges of the graph in Thorin actually point to the values and functions that are used.

Figure 3 shows that adding new branches (which may happen during optimization passes for example), is simpler than in CPS because you don’t need to think about scope.

Next we discussed the syntax, semantics, and liveness rules for Thorin (Figure 4). We actually spent a bit of time at this part. I’ll attempt to describe what we think the tricky bits meant. In the syntax section: A program is a map from labels (L) to functions with bodies (b). l (abstraction) is a function-label and l_i is a parameter to the function. And finally sigma is context necessary that when combined with some function l gives us a closure. In the semantics section: We’re not sure if we fully understand E_body, but we think it’s saying that if some label is just a function application of a closure, we can just say this is a bigger closure. In the liveness section: L-param says that l is live in l’ if a parameter of l is used within the body of l’, and L-abs is transitivity of liveness.

Omitted from this paper is an actual description of how you might turn an AST into a Thorin graph. Both Chris and I wish that this were here. We assume that it was omitted because it could be considered “too easy” as you should have the dependency information in your AST at the time you’d go down to this representation.

We actually didn’t get too much further here. We may touch upon the lambda mangling algorithm next week. It is worth noting that lambda lifting (taking closures and lifting them to top-level functions) sort of feels like defunctionalization just without the data type. And lambda-dropping is sort of like refunctionalization.

I’ve read this paper a few times over the past few months. This time I understood it more than before, but still didn’t understand a few things, but the discussion mostly cleared it up (at least the parts that we did discuss) — hopefully these notes may help someone else feeling the same way.
